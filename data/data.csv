The UNEP Governing Council, in its Decision 27/12 on Chemicals and waste management, welcomed the integrated approach and underscored that the three components of an integrated approach, mainstreaming, industry involvement and dedicated external finance, are mutually reinforcing and are all important for the financing of sound management of chemicals and waste.  \n\nThe first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-1), in June 2014, in resolution 1/5 on Chemicals and Waste, further adopted the terms of reference for a Special Programme, to be funded by voluntary contributions, to support institutional strengthening at the national level to enhance the implementation of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, the Minamata Convention on Mercury and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM). The Special Programme is one of two complementary elements of dedicated external financing under the integrated approach, with the GEF being the other element. \n\nThe Special Programme is part of the subprogramme 5 on chemicals and wastes in UNEP&rsquo;s Programme of Work, as it provides dedicated support to institutional strengthening at the national level towards the implementation of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, the Minamata Convention and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM). It specifically addresses expected accomplishment (a) that countries increasingly have the necessary institutional capacity and policy instruments to manage chemicals and waste soundly including the implementation of related provisions in the multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). \n\nThe present project document is pursuant to UNEA-1 resolution 1/5 that requests UNEP to provide a Special Programme trust fund and a secretariat to deliver administrative support to the Programme. The main outputs will include: servicing of the Special Programme Executive Board and management and administration of the Special Programme Trust Fund including provision of operational arrangements (project management and administrative support) in line with the objectives of the Special Programme terms of reference.\n\nThe project&rsquo;s expected outcome is to ensure that sound chemicals and waste management is adequately addressed in international, regional and national decision making and affirmative actions are taken by countries to manage chemicals and waste soundly.",0,22217616,0,19431608,0,16994678,0,28990240,Ukraine,1.547495,Industry,Chemicals,100,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-DAC-41116-PROJECT-01967

Freshwater ecosystems such as lakes, rivers, wetlands and aquifers are uniquely important and yet particularly under threat. Under competition from many users for a multiple of different productive, municipal and economic uses, they bear the brunt of human activity through over extraction and pollution and will keenly feel the effects of climate change. Their protection, restoration and management is of utmost concern and importance to all, particularly considering that the majority of UN Member States, 151 out of 193 countries, share part or all of their water resources with another country. These concepts form the basis of the rationale behind Sustainable Development Goal (6), &ldquo;Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,&rdquo; the achievement of which would be instrumental for securing sustainable development. \n\nYet a lack of information, capacity, incentives, tools and involvement of stakeholders including gender aspects is hindering actors, from individual to government to corporate level, from taking steps to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems and achieve water-related SDG targets. Poor land and water management and growing competition, leading to the degradation of water-related ecosystems and the loss of their critical services, is a growing concern worldwide, with an urgent need for action. It is estimated that the world has already lost at least 60% of its natural water bodies since wide-scale development began in 1900, and that one-third to one-seventh of rivers in developing countries face severe pathogenic and organic pollution, including from a lack of safely managed wastewater and from run-off from land-based activities. Growing water stress in many parts of the world, as well as drought and desertification, are further serious concerns which the World Economic Forum among others has identified as some of the most serious threats facing our current and future societies and businesses. At the same time, since most countries share important transboundary water resources, information sharing and cooperation across borders is essential, requiring technical assistance and trust-building measures. There is growing concern that failure to do so can lead to tension and conflict, and further degradation of water bodies. Robust and abundant evidence also exists that freshwater resources are particularly vulnerable and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate change, with wide-ranging consequences for human societies and ecosystems. Given future trends of population growth, development, and climate change, the integrated management of water resources across uses and users is therefore of utmost importance to ensure the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems and their services.",0,8321824,0,7551633.5,0,6511348,0,11077252,Ukraine,0.84033614,Water Supply & Sanitation,Water resources conservation (including data collection),100,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-DAC-41116-PROJECT-02052

As of now, there is manual management in a company. Management team members have different views on the framework for building a business process/management system. Business processes of the company are not defined or regulated. For 26 years, the company had been state owned and consisted of 31 independent companies which were united only in 2017. The most widespread tools at the company are still Excel and Google documents. Data is stored in different formats and is not interrelated. The management needs to wait for reports or entry data relevant for management decision-making from two hours to several days. All this is exacerbated by inflated number of staff, excessive and obsolete bureaucracy, poor confidentiality of information, inefficient use of resources and limited information for management decisions.\n2) Human resources:UA:PBC inherited corporate culture, which is typical for a dependent and controlled state institution and is inconsistent with the current values of the company. This culture has been hampering changes and demotivating the best staff.\n3) Content:The old system of state television was oriented at the government and focused on the interests of officials. To work for the benefit of the people and be a source of credible and truthful information about society UA: PBC needs effective tools to measure public opinion. Currently, the company does not have such tools and decisions what content to produce are taken without having sufficient evidence-based information. This significantly influences the quality and format of the content as well as the ways of its distribution.Becoming an effective company is possible only after solving all the above-mentioned challenges, i.e. full transformation of UA:PBC’s management system, corporate culture and change of content production approaches.These needs for changes are the basis for the implementation of UA:PBC's development Strategy for 2020-2022. Four vectors of transformation were chosen for implementation of this Strategy: organizational, technological, content transformation and transformation of corporate culture. Project’s outcomes cover an important part of the success factors that must be achieved in all transformation vectors.\nThere is a good common ground, joint understanding and commitment of the key stakeholders to work on organizational, digital, and corporate culture transformations as well as on enhancing audience outreach and engagement. The plan for this intervention is to make a concentrated effort to conduct full organizational transformation of the public service media system in Ukraine.\nTheory of changeThe following objectives are proposed:Development objective: Effective and competitive public service broadcaster in Ukraine as a tool for democracy and empowerment.Project objective: Transformed management system, corporate culture and approaches to content production of public service broadcaster in Ukraine\nThe draft Result-based management (RBM) matrix for the project puts forward four outcomes and several outputs. The proposed outcomes are closely interlinked and causal relations can be traced in the programme document. Workflow automation is impossible without transition to system management. Transformation of corporate culture should be strengthened by providing appropriate tools for staff, namely clear “rules of game” (workflows); and IT systems for implementing these rules. The cooperation partner plans to finalize the RBM Matrix with realistic numbers added at the output, activities and indicators level after the inception period, as soon as the procured consultants for each component process the results of their initial diagnostics and audits. The application of RBM matrix as a steering tool implies regular follow up and adjustments to stay on track and reach the intended results.\nThe Embassy assesses this as a feasible plan. However, the cooperation partner obviously lacks RBM application knowledge, e.g. separate ""theories of change"" were suggested for every component of the project, but an umbrella vision has not been framed properly in the respective section of the proposal, even though it can be elicited from the programme document in its other parts. The Embassy suggests additional RBM training for the staff of this cooperation partner during the inception phase of the project, preferably the one organized by Sida Partnership Forum. \nProject contentFull organizational transformation will take time and considerable effort. Therefore, the Embassy assesses  that a proposed project time span of three years will be necessary to conduct the transformation. Detailed project outcomes, outputs, activities, baselines, indicators and time frame are described in the draft RBM matrix.\nOutcome 1. Conducted transition from manual management (micromanagement) to process management (through goals and workflows)UA:PBC’s goal is to transform the existing management system to a fundamentally new level, focused on efficiency, clarity and transparency. The evolution of the transformation of UA:PBC’s management system can be seen in the chart below. Currently, UA:PBC aims to make a transition to process management.\nEvolution of the transformation of the management system:Process management is a management approach in which a company is viewed as a network of interconnected business processes rather than distinct functions, as opposed to a functional approach. The advantage of process management is its focus on the end result of each individual business process, which is a sequence of operations, and set of processes. Process approach allows evaluating the contribution of each business process to the end result of the company’s activities, which triggers positive effect for employees’ motivation. Optimization of business processes will contribute to the company's sustainable opreation as an independent and effective institution.More than 20% of the Roadmap's recommendations are devoted to the design of business processes and are included in this project. Their implementation is one of the most complex and largest tasks, since it concerns almost the entire company and will have noticeable impact. Processes will be not only described but also optimized showing how to use employees’ time more effectively. This can lead to the improvement of organization’s structure and, hence, to optimization of human resources. It also foresees the reduction of the level of bureaucracy as well as effective distribution of authority. Launch of the process approach will reduce timeframes of decision-making as well as enhance decision-making efficiency. This will all also lead to savings of financial resources.\nOutcome 2. Automated workflowsDigital transformation involves creating databases, developing products, automatization of business processes, integration of accounting financial and personnel systems of the central directorate and branches into a single system, and developing a cross-cutting analytics system that will enhance the company’s efficiency.The chart below shows how single information space should look like:\nAutomatization would enable optimization of human and financial resources and increase of transparency of financial and personnel processes. Since single information storage is envisioned in this system, the reliability and confidentiality of information would increase. As a result, NPBU's would stregthen its competitiveness and improve its image as a modern innovative institution. Technological changes will affect all the staff and will lead to significant improvement of the quality of financial and personnel services. Employees will also have a platform for internal communication, which increases openness. The company will be fully digitalized.\nOutcome 3. Transformed corporate culture fitting UA:PBC’s values and missionFormation and development of the corporate culture is an important task and a prerequisite for the effective implementation of changes at UA:PBC and its sustainable development.The external influence of the organization is directly related to its internal integrity and ideology. That is why the internal culture of the public broadcaster must be as consistent as possible and not only contribute to the effectiveness of the organization itself, but also to the strengthening of UA:PBC’s position and its role in the formation of national consciousness. Corporate culture also creates employees’ engagement and is a key to managing the organization.UA:PBC’s goal is to create the desired vision of the organization’s culture in order to achieve an influential position of UA:PBC outside and have attractive image as an employer inside and outside as well as to set up HR system so that the desired organization culture is built up as efficiently as possible.After the transformation of corporate culture employees’ engagement, motivation, loyalty as well as efficiency will significantly increase, managers at any level will understand where and how the company changes and what is required from them. This will also increase the speed of internal communication as well as its quality.\nOutcome 4. UA: PBC becomes a reputable source of information by using public opinion trendsUA:PBC needs to know exactly what is bothering Ukrainians and discuss these issues. This is a fundamental function of the public service broadcaster, a key component of the brand and its reputation.By establishing a well-functioning and innovative marketing department, UA:PBC will be able to:• get quick public opinion on current issues;• systematically cooperate with experts who generate issues that need actualization in society;• discuss all current issues and topics on the air and create socially important content;• disseminate the received data in the country's information space.The products' menu should include analytics, data, metrics, ratings, value orientations which will be used internally by program director, producers, editors, PR department, Management Board and externally by leaders of public opinion, mass media, think tanks, and public authorities.A well functioning and innovative marketing department will be able to help NPBU shape the social agenda, produce annual reports on social trends and set standards. At the internal level UA:PBC will be able to control the achievement of its marketing goals, generate evidence-based themes for the creative team, study regional audiences and their needs.",542905.9,558928,446264.34,474044.4,404902.44,418088.06,695441.25,715849.06,Ukraine,100,Government & Civil Society-general,Media and free flow of information,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-13735A0101-UKR-15153

This significantly influences the quality and format of the content as well as the ways of its distribution.Becoming an effective company is possible only after solving all the above-mentioned challenges, i.e. full transformation of UA:PBC’s management system, corporate culture and change of content production approaches.These needs for changes are the basis for the implementation of UA:PBC's development Strategy for 2020-2022. Four vectors of transformation were chosen for implementation of this Strategy: organizational, technological, content transformation and transformation of corporate culture. Project’s outcomes cover an important part of the success factors that must be achieved in all transformation vectors.\nThere is a good common ground, joint understanding and commitment of the key stakeholders to work on organizational, digital, and corporate culture transformations as well as on enhancing audience outreach and engagement. The plan for this intervention is to make a concentrated effort to conduct full organizational transformation of the public service media system in Ukraine.\nTheory of changeThe following objectives are proposed:Development objective: Effective and competitive public service broadcaster in Ukraine as a tool for democracy and empowerment.Project objective: Transformed management system, corporate culture and approaches to content production of public service broadcaster in Ukraine\nThe draft Result-based management (RBM) matrix for the project puts forward four outcomes and several outputs. The proposed outcomes are closely interlinked and causal relations can be traced in the programme document. Workflow automation is impossible without transition to system management. Transformation of corporate culture should be strengthened by providing appropriate tools for staff, namely clear “rules of game” (workflows); and IT systems for implementing these rules. The cooperation partner plans to finalize the RBM Matrix with realistic numbers added at the output, activities and indicators level after the inception period, as soon as the procured consultants for each component process the results of their initial diagnostics and audits. The application of RBM matrix as a steering tool implies regular follow up and adjustments to stay on track and reach the intended results.\nThe Embassy assesses this as a feasible plan. However, the cooperation partner obviously lacks RBM application knowledge, e.g. separate ""theories of change"" were suggested for every component of the project, but an umbrella vision has not been framed properly in the respective section of the proposal, even though it can be elicited from the programme document in its other parts. The Embassy suggests additional RBM training for the staff of this cooperation partner during the inception phase of the project, preferably the one organized by Sida Partnership Forum. \nProject contentFull organizational transformation will take time and considerable effort. Therefore, the Embassy assesses  that a proposed project time span of three years will be necessary to conduct the transformation. Detailed project outcomes, outputs, activities, baselines, indicators and time frame are described in the draft RBM matrix.\nOutcome 1. Conducted transition from manual management (micromanagement) to process management (through goals and workflows)UA:PBC’s goal is to transform the existing management system to a fundamentally new level, focused on efficiency, clarity and transparency. The evolution of the transformation of UA:PBC’s management system can be seen in the chart below. Currently, UA:PBC aims to make a transition to process management.\nEvolution of the transformation of the management system:Process management is a management approach in which a company is viewed as a network of interconnected business processes rather than distinct functions, as opposed to a functional approach. The advantage of process management is its focus on the end result of each individual business process, which is a sequence of operations, and set of processes. Process approach allows evaluating the contribution of each business process to the end result of the company’s activities, which triggers positive effect for employees’ motivation. Optimization of business processes will contribute to the company's sustainable opreation as an independent and effective institution.More than 20% of the Roadmap's recommendations are devoted to the design of business processes and are included in this project. Their implementation is one of the most complex and largest tasks, since it concerns almost the entire company and will have noticeable impact. Processes will be not only described but also optimized showing how to use employees’ time more effectively. This can lead to the improvement of organization’s structure and, hence, to optimization of human resources. It also foresees the reduction of the level of bureaucracy as well as effective distribution of authority. Launch of the process approach will reduce timeframes of decision-making as well as enhance decision-making efficiency. This will all also lead to savings of financial resources.\nOutcome 2. Automated workflowsDigital transformation involves creating databases, developing products, automatization of business processes, integration of accounting financial and personnel systems of the central directorate and branches into a single system, and developing a cross-cutting analytics system that will enhance the company’s efficiency.The chart below shows how single information space should look like:\nAutomatization would enable optimization of human and financial resources and increase of transparency of financial and personnel processes. Since single information storage is envisioned in this system, the reliability and confidentiality of information would increase. As a result, NPBU's would stregthen its competitiveness and improve its image as a modern innovative institution. Technological changes will affect all the staff and will lead to significant improvement of the quality of financial and personnel services. Employees will also have a platform for internal communication, which increases openness. The company will be fully digitalized.\nOutcome 3. Transformed corporate culture fitting UA:PBC’s values and missionFormation and development of the corporate culture is an important task and a prerequisite for the effective implementation of changes at UA:PBC and its sustainable development.The external influence of the organization is directly related to its internal integrity and ideology. That is why the internal culture of the public broadcaster must be as consistent as possible and not only contribute to the effectiveness of the organization itself, but also to the strengthening of UA:PBC’s position and its role in the formation of national consciousness. Corporate culture also creates employees’ engagement and is a key to managing the organization.UA:PBC’s goal is to create the desired vision of the organization’s culture in order to achieve an influential position of UA:PBC outside and have attractive image as an employer inside and outside as well as to set up HR system so that the desired organization culture is built up as efficiently as possible.After the transformation of corporate culture employees’ engagement, motivation, loyalty as well as efficiency will significantly increase, managers at any level will understand where and how the company changes and what is required from them. This will also increase the speed of internal communication as well as its quality.\nOutcome 4. UA: PBC becomes a reputable source of information by using public opinion trendsUA:PBC needs to know exactly what is bothering Ukrainians and discuss these issues. This is a fundamental function of the public service broadcaster, a key component of the brand and its reputation.By establishing a well-functioning and innovative marketing department, UA:PBC will be able to:• get quick public opinion on current issues;• systematically cooperate with experts who generate issues that need actualization in society;• discuss all current issues and topics on the air and create socially important content;• disseminate the received data in the country's information space.The products' menu should include analytics, data, metrics, ratings, value orientations which will be used internally by program director, producers, editors, PR department, Management Board and externally by leaders of public opinion, mass media, think tanks, and public authorities.A well functioning and innovative marketing department will be able to help NPBU shape the social agenda, produce annual reports on social trends and set standards. At the internal level UA:PBC will be able to control the achievement of its marketing goals, generate evidence-based themes for the creative team, study regional audiences and their needs.",434324.7,395737.9,357011.47,373518.9,323921.97,325129.75,556353,537744.7,Ukraine,100,Government & Civil Society-general,,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-13735A0102-UKR-15153

The Russian war of aggression on Ukraine has triggered one of the biggest humanitarian crises ever and escalated the already difficult housing situation. The number of people displaced from their homes is currently estimated at over 13.2 million. Of these, more than 6.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and another 6.6 million within Ukraine, according to UNHCR. As a result, communities estimate that more than 10% of IDPs will remain long-term or permanently in their place of displacement, where host communities are stretched to their limits in providing sustainable shelter for IDPs. This project aims to increase the number of usable homes and the number of potential applications for these homes. This will be done, inter alia, through new construction, reconstruction or repair of buildings and an increase of the capacity of the Ukrainian government and local authorities. In the process, protection against sexual exploitation and abuse is to be ensured by providing special training to local partners and staff, and by providing beneficiaries with extensive information about their rights and the relevant complaints bodies.",87713736,62085856,72100000,58600000,65417428,51008404,112357880,84364776,Ukraine,100,Other Social Infrastructure & Services,Low-cost housing,100,,Kyiv,30.5238,50.45466,2,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=DE-1-201867597

These will contribute to increasing the competitiveness of local agribusiness and assist in future-proofing these climate change risks through both investments in sustainable agribusiness and awareness raising.  By focusing on waste utilisation, the Project will provide various benefits for the local private agricultural sector. It will focus on adding value to production residues which will be processed through sustainable energy production systems and thus decrease environmental pressure and reduce GHG emissions.

These principles are: moral and financial independence, strict political and religious neutrality, non-discrimination, free and direct access to victims, professionalism and transparency. The principles are outlined in an agreement (the International Global Protocols), which is signed by all AAH members.Through this contribution, Sida will be supporting AAH with funding which will allow for AAH to provide humanitarian assistance to affected population in more than 20 countries worldwide, such as Ethiopia, Syria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan and Sudan.

Nutrition interventions are complemented by activities which seek to ensure that people have access to clean water, food, healthcare and protection. By being present before and after disaster strikes, AAH is committed not only to respond to emergency needs, but also to build and to strengthen the capacity and resilience of the local communities.

NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida's Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC's capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida's humanitarian unit's annual budget appropriation.The objectives of NRC can be summarized as follows: ""To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.""  NRCs main activity is delivery of humanitarian assistance through programme activities in the field. NRC specializes in six areas of expertise, or ""core competencies"": shelter and settlements; livelihoods and food security; information, counselling and legal assistance (ICLA); education; camp management; and water, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH). Protection is lifted up as a new core competency of NRC since 2021. NRC engages closely with the affected populations to understand their needs and capacities, ensuring it tailors its assistance accordingly and involve them in the entire programme cycle, from design through implementation to evaluation. NRC advocates for respect for the rights of displaced and vulnerable people.In 2021, the NRC Board approved the Global Strategy 20222025. The strategysets out four sub-objectives for areas that NRC will continue to strengthen and further institutionalize, namely, 1. assistance to hard-to-reach populations, 2. humanitarian policy, 3. protection, and 4. durable solutions. It also points to four areas of work that will be accelerated through expanded engagement and investments: i) advocacy, ii) climate and environment, iii) collaboration with  local actors, and iv) quality programming.NRCs work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment. Sida's Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC's method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025.NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out the Humanitarian Programme for 2021 in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.The interventions tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sidas funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR, etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach  PBA).NRC's catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC's advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC's analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC's portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden's development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.In 2022 support NRC with 455.5 MSEK in total of Sidas humanitarian funding, according to the following breakdown:- The grant will support NRC humanitarian programmes in 23 crises settings that Sida has prioritized through its needs-based allocation model, with 288.5 MSEK during 2022.- As multi-annual funding for emergency response in DR Congo, Mali and Nigeria is initiated in 2022, the grant will provide as well NRC with outstanding financial commitments from Sida, estimated 104 MSEK for 2023-2024.- NRC emergency response in sudden onset crises will be supported through Sidas Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) window with 50 MSEK for 2022.- NRCs method and capacity development projects for Protection, Environment and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) will receive 13 MSEK, including 3 MSEK from Sida/Globen for IDMC.Sidas contribution to NRC for 2022 will cover around 6.5% of NRCs total financial requirements of the supported programmes and projects. It will provides humanitarian services to almost 9 million persons (53% female). HUM adds 50 MSEK for NRC's 2022 country programme in Ukraine benefiting 90,000 people with protection, shelter, WaSH and cash assistance. Decision 5 April. Amendment nr. 5.HUM adds 7.5 MSEK for NRC's 2022 country programme in Cameroon from the 2022 mid-year allocation (food security, legal advice for 600 households/4200 individuals in Logone-et-Chari, Mayo Sava and Mayo Tsanaga). Decision 9 June 2022. Contract amendment No 6.From Conclusion on performances September 2022:NRC foresees that 8,986,125 persons (53.4% female) will benefit from NRC's humanitarian services in 2022 in 35 crisis settings. It is however likely that NRC will over-achieve again its initial target.NRC is on a continued trajectory of growth in the delivery of cash and vouchers to people affected by displacement.  The trend should be brought at scale, given the multiplying effect on empowered beneficiaries. Impacts of Multi-purpose cash assistance could be researched and highlighted further by NRC for promoting cash assistance as the best option, becoming hopefully the default method for the provision of humanitarian assistance everywhere and for all actors.Education was a declining sector for NRC in 2020 and 2021 due to closure of schools under Covid-19. It generated many new protection risks, like early marriage for girls, early pregnancies, drop-out of school-aged children from education, and psychosocial needs. Restart of education services is going on in 2022. Meanwhile, following the pandemic, NRC saw the rapid scale up of psychosocial support programme, the Better Learning Programme (BLP). Building on lessons learned from the Middle East region, it has rolled-out BLP to both Central and West Africa (CWA) and Latin America. To reach children stuck at home, NRC developed a BLP smartphone application for both parents and teachers.ProtectionNRC developed Minimum Standards on Safe and Inclusive Programming (protection mainstreaming) which are now incorporated into the Global Strategy (2022-2025) as a critical component of programme quality. Mainstreamed and integrated protection are generating increasingly protection outcomes within NRC's humanitarian assistance.Protection is evolving into a full new core competence of NRC as from 2022 with stand-alone protection capacities and interventions wherever relevant.NRC has been essential in hosting the Sida-funded IASC protection policy review in 2021.Information, Counselling and Legal Assistance (ICLA) in particular for Housing, Land and Property issues (HLP) remain the domain of excellence of NRC that only few other protection actors can match and replace. Solved documentation problems related to legal identity, civil status and property is key to the protection of the displaced people, including children and women. Inclusive programmingNRC reports a systematic engagement with communities in term of participation to the design and orientation of the response.Its ambition to shift resolutely towards increased equal to equal partnerships, especially to mobilize local resources among the civil society, was not yet articulated in 2021 in term of localized partnerships and will be hopefully worked through during the strategic cycle 2022-2025. NRC has a long way to go, as its is mainly implementing interventions by itself.Sida's helpdesk on gender had reservation about NRC's effective gender mainstreaming in programming and reporting. The outcome is certainly better, in most cases, than reported. NRC has to ensure that it captures this dimension in its programme documents (both applications and reports).Data security and protection risk management do not give visibility to the assistance and the protection services delivered by NRC to LGBTQI people. Sida should respect this and not request specific dis-aggregated data capturing this beneficiary groups. Sida has evidence that NRC protection work is non-discriminatory and reaches out effectively people with specific needs, including LGBTQI people. CoordinationNRC is a key asset of the global and local humanitarian systems for its dedicated participation to coordination forums, bringing to them its principled approach and expertise for humanitarian action: the IASC, humanitarian country teams, advisory groups, clusters, hosted and facilitated NGO forums, working groups in many areas and sectors, including durable solutions to displacements. It is not infrequent that NRC co-leads protection, shelter, food security, education, camp management clusters. Such constructive participation is making a difference and is likely to improve the humanitarian system.Advocacy 2021NRC continued its advocacy work on Sanctions and Counter-terrorism measures affecting humanitarian service delivery, in particular in Afghanistan.NRC released its flagship annual report on the Worlds Most Neglected Displacement Crises, which analyses displacement crises based on lack of funding, lack of media attention, and lack of international political and diplomatic initiatives.NRC's Secretary General became the Eminent Person of the Grand Bargain. Through this role, NRC is in a unique position to steer reforms aimed at improving the system, through efforts such as ensuring that implementing organisations receive a critical mass of quality funding and working towards making the aid system more localized.NRC's Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), co-funded by HUM and INTEM at Sida, launched its 2021 Global Report on Internal Displacement (GRID), featuring a special focus on disaster displacement and the impacts of climate change, exploring the intersections of climate, disasters, and internal displacement.Most country offices are producing frequent advocacy documents about the rights of displaced populations, voiceless affected communities and humanitarian contexts that are highly appreciated and of good quality.Humanitarian policy-making 2021As part of NRCs Global Strategy process, a Climate and Environment Strategy 2030 was developed, focusing on strengthening NRCs response in the areas of climate adaptation, access to clean energy, and reduced environmental footprint. NRC also signed the Climate and Environment Charter for Humanitarian Organisations, which entails a commitment to work on climate adaptation and mitigation, including through setting public time-bound targets for emissions reductions. NRC also initiated work to establish environmental minimum standards for its programmes. These were developed for shelter and settlements, WASH, livelihood and food security, and emergency response.NexusNRC has drawn lessons from pilot experience of 'humanitarian mediation' in Mali, DRC and CAR during 2017-2020 that was funded by Sida/FRED (#11611). The external final evaluation concluded that this pilot phase of introducing peace-building within the scope of NRC's programmes would deserve to be followed by another pilot experience correcting the shortcomings of the initiative that was found not fully relevant, efficient and successful. The lack of capacities in implementing the new programme in three very challenging contexts was pointed out. It does not mean that NRC should abandon the idea to try again. Preventing protection risks, including those resulting to forced displacements, by mitigating tensions and antagonism between communities, is highly needed in crisis contexts. But it requires an expertise and partnerships that cannot be built overnight. NRC should be encouraged to persist.NRC is better placed for linking emergency and recovery when it explores and supports durable solutions to displacement. The development leg of the nexus falls within NRC's natural mandate, although it cannot or should not be resourced by Sida's humanitarian funding, but rather by development budget-lines. NRC is meant to support IDPs and refugees before, during and after displacements and to accompany them until displacements cease to affect them, because they could be repatriated, resettled or locally integrated in a sustainable and dignified way. It is unclear whether durable solutions interventions of NRC are budgeted within NRC's country humanitarian programmes that are submitted to Sida or resourced within longer-term strategies. It is not unusual that Sida colleagues visiting NRC in the field give as a feedback that NRC's interventions are getting near development work, because the response is protracted and because it addresses rather recovery needs than life-saving needs. HUM is however very clear to NRC in its dialogue by highlighting that HUM funding is for humanitarian interventions only and within the frameworks of OCHA's and UNHCR's humanitarian appeals, if they exist. It is however often difficult, if one should ever do it, to draw a clear and separate line between humanitarian action and recovery/resilience/durable solutions. In some countries, especially in protracted refugee / displacement situations that are no more acute crises, support to care and maintenance, to self-reliance and to durable solutions, like in Jordan for instance, represents the bulk of NRC's programme, while emergency life-saving and protection services are less necessary. Such interventions would be better supported by longer-term development or recovery budget-lines, within the framework of the Global Compact for Refugees and the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework. Development donors are increasingly getting involved, including Sida, but too slow, too late and too short. Meanwhile, assisting aid-dependent IDPs and refugees throughout the years / decades of their displacement career, like the Palestinan refugees and many other caseloads, remains resourced mainly by humanitarian budget-lines, including Sida's.Sida's assessment on performance and resultsAlike many other actors in the sector, NRC excels in reporting activities and outputs, but should be better in catching what changes and impacts its interventions have resulted to ultimately on assisted communities. The reporting of data and results does not provide necessarily an accurate and consolidated overview of what NRC has achieved. Sida has notified NRC that it should provide dis-aggregated data by age in targeting and reporting which is a norm.NRC has still a long way to go for building programme partnerships and localizing its programmes. NRC channeled Sida funding in 2021 to only 15 partners in total, including 4 INGOs, for a very little proportion of the total humanitarian funding received from Sida, below 1%, less than in 2019 and 2020 (3%). NRC is however party to many consortia and excels in cooperating with local authorities and actors, and building their capacitries, although not through financial transactions.Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM)HUM granted 40 MSEK to NRC in 2021 as the annual RRM allocation amount, without replenishment during the course of the year, as in 2019. NRC managed to utilize this emergency response funding window sparingly until October 2021, supporting 14 projects in 13 countries. In 2022, the allocation amounted to 50 MSEK;  this funding allocation is almost completely exhausted (4 MSEK left), after support to 12 projects in 12 countries has been approved.",2473362,2473362,2270240,2270240,1979094.4,1979094.4,3339395,3339395,Ukraine,100,Emergency Response,,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-14395A0101-H11173

Since then, Sida has been one of the largest donors to the CBPFs. During 2019, the CBPFs received 956 million USD in financial contributions to respond to humanitarian needs in 18 countries. \n\nThe CBPFs fund UN, NGOs and the Red Cross/Red Crescent Society. During the years, the CBPFs has increased its funding to local actors. In 2014 they reached 11% with direct funding, compared to todays 31 %.   \n\nCBPFs are locally managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator and in consultation with the humanitarian community. Advisory Boards oversee the Funds, providing advice on key decisions, and ensuring efficient and effective management. The daily management of the funds is overseen by a Fund Manager, monitoring officers and financial officers. At the global level, the Pooled Fund Working Group brings together key stakeholders (representing donors, NGOs and UN agencies) to provide policy guidance. \n\nThe main value added of the CBPF will be ensuring an efficient humanitarian response due to the specific strengths the fund entails:\n\n1) Proximity to the response: The CBPFs aims to address humanitarian needs through a structure with high degree of local expertise of both the humanitarian situation and the humanitarian actors on the ground.\n\n2) Humanitarian Coordination: The CBPF has a strategic objective of ensuring the implementation of the Humanitarian Response Plan and its various components/ programmes. The Humanitarian Coordinator can hence direct funding to critical components in the HRP that are underfunded. The Humanitarian Coordinator can also at any time direct humanitarian funding to sudden onset emergencies or quickly deteriorating crises, through the quick funding mechanism called “Emergency Reserve”. The overall coordination is naturally strengthened by the fact that the ultimate authority of the mandate lies with the Humanitarian Coordinator who is the overall coordinator of the UN lead humanitarian response in any given country. \n\n3) Reach the best placed actors, which in many cases are local actors who has the expertise and humanitarian access. The CBPF can support local actors in responding to the humanitarian needs. This has been particularly useful when local actors have shown to have the local expertise needed to adequately formulate smaller local responses and also having humanitarian access to areas not accessible by international actors. During 2019, the CBPF allocated 25% directly to local actors and in some countries up to 50% is allocated directly to local partners.   \n\nMoreover, the CBPFs aim to ensure that projects consider the specific needs and constraints faced by women, girls, boys and men. The CBPFs do so by promoting sound gender analysis and gender integration in all projects. The Pooled Fund Disability Inclusion Contact Group composed of independent experts advise on how to improve the funds' work with people with disabilities. This is to ensure that disability inclusion is taken into account in all CBPF processes.

Their mission is to help people whose lives and livelihoods have been shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to survive, recover and gain control of their future.IRC consider their interventions successful when their clients see improvement in their safety from physical, sexual and psychological harm; in their health status, including physical and mental well-being; in education, including literacy and numeracy, social-emotional, and life skills (including safe schools); in economic well-being, including ability to provide basic material needs and income asset growth; and in power to have influence over the decisions that affect their lives. IRC strive to reach these goals while continuously trying to tackle gender inequalities in and through all of their work.

Their mission is to help people whose lives and livelihoods have been shattered by conflict and disaster, including the climate crisis, to survive, recover and gain control of their future.IRC consider their interventions successful when their clients see improvement in their safety from physical, sexual and psychological harm; in their health status, including physical and mental well-being; in education, including literacy and numeracy, social-emotional, and life skills (including safe schools); in economic well-being, including ability to provide basic material needs and income asset growth; and in power to have influence over the decisions that affect their lives. IRC strive to reach these goals while continuously trying to tackle gender inequalities in and through all of their work.   As Sida supports IRC in a variety of countries, not one specific objective can be identified for the whole contribution, but for the sake of exemplifying, a number of country specific goals are outlined below:CAR:  People are safe in their communities and receive support when they experience harm (safety); women and girls are protected from and treated for the consequences of gender-based violence (safety); children survive and are healthy (health).South Sudan: People are safe in their communities and receive support when they experience harm (safety); Children are well nourished and protected from all forms of under-nutrition (health); People develop their livelihoods and recover from shocks (economic well-being).Ukraine: people's basic needs are met and their livelihoods are protected (economic well-being); crisis-affected populations have access to quality essential health services, including mental health and psycho-social support, to prevent and reduce excess mortality and morbidity (health); affected populations are protected from violence in their homes and communities and treated for the consequences of violence through equitable access to services and information (safety).

Over time, the problem of ensuring food security in the territory not controlled by the government of Ukraine has not only not lost its relevance, but on the contrary has become even more acute as a result of restrictions caused by COVID-19, the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises, the reduction of the business sector, rising unemployment, rising prices and, as a result, lack of livelihood. All these factors directly continue to have a negative impact on millions of people.  The situation of many has become even more vulnerable compared to previous years. The most vulnerable groups in need of humanitarian assistance are still the elderly and people with disabilities and serious medical diseases. In conditions of insecurity, people cannot or do not want to leave their homes. To survive, they often rely on their meager income and the ability to access basic services at their place of residence, relying on the help and support of other family members or neighbors.  The lack of means of subsistence not only threatens food security, but also increases vulnerability, constantly forcing people to make impossible choices between food, medicines, payments for water, gas, heating and the purchase of clothing and shoes. The analysis of the situation shows that in order to make ends meet, people resort to negative survival strategies, such as reducing food and healthcare costs, the conflict has had a significant impact on the agricultural sector, which is traditionally the main sector of life support in these territories. For households in rural and semi-urban areas, subsistence agriculture has always been an important activity to support food security. In particular, ensuring food security through agricultural activities of poultry farming, beekeeping and animal husbandry is extremely necessary for both the elderly and people with disabilities, since this is a very important and necessary if not the only source that partially covers the needs for food or makes it possible to purchase basic necessities, in particular: clothing, hygiene and sanitation products, medicines, due to the sale of surplus products.  The main difficulties faced by people who run a subsistence economy are the lack of money for the necessary resources: agricultural equipment, greenhouses, irrigation systems, milking machines.

Participating MSMEs will receive grants to invest in new equipment and training to help them make the necessary business adjustments and make the best use of the new equipment. Cooperatives and returnees must match the grants they receive with their own funds in the same amount, which also mobilises private capital for the project. For the implementation of the measure, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) will continue to be involved as recipient of the funds and executing agency.

XI-BRIDGE-6385676864-10454,Global Environment Facility,XI-BRIDGE-6385676864,XI-BRIDGE-6385676864,Low-carbon economy of Ukraine for climate change prevention: Facilitating investment to scale-up innovative cleantech solutions for low-carbon economy and climate action,Implementation,2021-12-31,2026-11-26,"239.     The project is expected to result in more cleantech start-ups and SMEs being identified and supported, thus acting as a catalyst for entrepreneurship development and cleantech investment in Ukraine. The GCIP 2 Ukraine, as a dedicated national platform for promoting and supporting cleantech innovation, will result in an enhancement of human capital, thereby leading to job creation and poverty reduction as well as to an increased women participation in the entire value chain of technology development. New job opportunities in the country will in turn contribute to stemming the current brain drain. Local development and production of cleantech will very likely result in lower costs benefiting both the technology developers and end-users. It is noteworthy that so far around 84% of start-ups and SMEs, that participated in GCIP globally, have remained in business for minimum of five years. Finally, the increased use of cleantech innovations supported by the GCIP 2 Ukraine will also result in GHG emission reductions.       240.     The GCIP 2 Ukraine will highlight the need for a stronger support at the national level for cleantech innovations and start-ups/SMEs. In particular, it will provide added value by bridging the gap between cleantech innovators and investors, thereby paving the way for the creation of new businesses opportunities resulting in a value added for the domestic economy. At the same time, through engaging all relevant stakeholders in the national CIEE, and encouraging their cooperation, as well as through linking different CIEEs across countries, the GCIP 2 Ukraine will provide opportunities for international business scale-up and exchange of knowledge.                  241.      In summary, GCIP 2 Ukraine yields the following socio-economic benefits as a result of supporting and introducing cleantech into the market, strengthening national institutional capabilities, enhancing the availability of financial instruments, and encouraging inclusivity in the entrepreneurial and job markets. Specifically, these interventions lead to:    Enhancement of human capital  Entrepreneurial, environmental and technological skills development and awareness raising have the effect of a larger number of cleantech products/services being commercialized and entering the market. Better decisions are made by entrepreneurs regarding the sustainability and life cycle approach to the products/services and businesses.   Local product development and production with job creation and income generation   Fostering new local cleantech lowers costs, which benefits both the technology developer and end-user, and encourages consumers to buy more environmentally friendly products/services.  An enriched CIEE  The high-quality institutions build confidence of local and foreign investors as well as the small business community. Among others, this in turn leads to lower transactions costs and results in the increased demand for environmentally friendly technologies both from the investor and consumer side.   Improved energy access for people living in rural areas  At the same time investing in energy access, electrification and renewables are well known to contribute to the decarbonization of the economy. The project is also expected to promote a move away from traditional cooking and heating methods and therefore to reduce health risks.  Promotion of women and youth entrepreneurial development  In general, the promotion of women and youth inclusion tends to enhance the productivity and innovativeness of the economy. What is more, through the gender and youth mainstreaming the cooperation within communities will be enhanced and social cohesion strengthened. This will lead to increased resilience to economic and environmental shocks.       @font-face  {font-family:""Cambria Math"";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;

Raising the level of personal protection and dignity support for GBV survivors — increasing the accessibility of emergency kits through equipping the health care institutions with them\n2) Equipment of changing tables and places of personal hygiene of women during feeding in 10 health care institutions — improvement of sanitary and hygienic conditions of breastfeeding and swaddling, as well as meeting the needs caused by the peculiarities of women during postpartum lactation and protection of the dignity of mothers and children visiting health care institutions\n3) Support of existing repair teams in Novoazovskiy and Yasinovatskiy raions and the restoration of 80 housing facilities —repair teams have already proved to be an effective tool based on a community approach for the restoration of housing and social infrastructure facilities. Further support of repair teams in the Yasinovatskiy raion and scaling of this type of humanitarian aid to Novoazovskiy raion will increase the potential of communities to restore damage. The transferred construction materials will be used for the purpose of carrying out medium-sized repairs in the housing affected by the fighting\n4) Hygienic assistance to prisoners, including a gender-specific component in the form of feminine hygiene products — prisons are institutions that are limited for humanitarian access, but the need for hygiene products for prisoners is significant, especially in the conditions of COVID-19. Another aspect is the shortage of feminine hygiene products, which entails the use of improvised means, such a strategy can lead to diseases\n5) Equipment for improving the quality of services provided in 10 hospitals with an inpatient service— the provision of equipment for washing and cooking will allow patients who are on inpatient treatment to receive better services: food, washing. Also, the washing equipment will allow you to use soft equipment more effectively, reducing their wear and tear\n6) Equipment for medical offices in schools and vaccination offices — the provision of furniture, soft equipment, and medical equipment will improve the quality of first aid provided at school and will improve the conditions of vaccination for children\n7) 50 Grants for self-employment of the population — support for entrepreneurial initiatives of the affected population will reduce their dependence on humanitarian aid.\n\nThe duration of the project is 7 months.

Effektmålen beskriver ett önskat tillstånd, förändring eller resultat, alltså denönskade effekten av arbetet. I många fall ligger själva målformuleringarna på en hög och abstrakt nivå och kan inte helt och hållet uppnås under programperioden. Vad som mer specifikt förväntas kunna åstadkommas under perioden preciseras i resultatmatrisen via de indikatorer och verksamhetsmål som är kopplade till effektmålen.Som uppställningen nedan visar rapporterar den globala verksamheten inte på alla Framtidsstrategins mål. Det har främst att göra med avgränsning, resursfördelning och var Naturskyddsföreningen och samarbetsorganisationer på bästa sätt kan bidra till måluppfyllelsen. Flera av Framtidsstrategins långsiktiga mål är kopplade till föreningens arbete i Sverige.Verksamheten följs upp utifrån den tematiska inriktningen i stället för geografiskt. Detta förstärks av att flera av samarbetsorganisationerna är globala och av att både Naturskyddsfööreningens och samarbetsorganisationernas påverkansarbete utgår från tematiska perspektiv och inte geografiska ramar.Av de långsiktiga målen som beskrivs i Framtidsstrategin ska det Globala programmet bidra till följande:Målområde 1 AtmosfärenMål 1.2 Minskade utsläpp från konsumtion och produktionMål 1.3 Hållbar energiförsörjningInom målområdet atmosfären är insatserna framför allt relaterade till att motverka klimatförändringen och att minska/utrota energifattigdom.För att bidra till en utveckling mot ren luft och begränsad klimatpåverkan arbetar Naturskyddsföreningen med påverkansarbete, konsumentmakt, samverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser. Genom organisering och forum för interaktion med beslutsfattare möjliggör samarbetsorganisationerna målgruppens och individens möjlighet till påverkan och ansvarsutkrävande från beslutsfattare, företag och banker. Detta sker genom dialogforum, nationella arbetsgrupper, uppföljning av miljökonsekvensbeskrivningar och klimaträttsfall. Samarbetsorganisationerna bidrar även till att bygga och stärka allianser nationellt och internationellt.Kapacitetsstärkande insatser fokuserar på hur en miljömässigt, socialt och ekonomiskt hållbar energiomställning med ett integrerat livscykelperspektiv kan främjas. Framtidsstrategins långsiktiga mål är att stärka samarbetsorganisationerna och Naturskyddsföreningens arbete med en rättvis omställning genom att öka kunskapen och erfarenhetsutbytet om olika perspektiv på omställningen.Målområde 2 Landbaserade ekosystemMål 2.1 Hållbart brukande och hållbar resursanvändningMål 2.2 Skyddade och bevarade arter, populationer och värdefulla områdenInom Naturskyddsföreningens målområde landbaserade ekosystem, syftar insatserna framför allt till att stärka den biologiska mångfalden och attmotverka negativ klimatpåverkan. I detta målområde fokuserar arbetet på tropiska skogar och småskaligt jordbruk.Naturskyddsföreningen arbetar för hållbara produktionssystem inom skogs- ochjordbrukssektorn och för att minska överutnyttjandet av naturresurser. Som ett led i detta arbete driver Naturskyddsföreningen på för att uppnå bindande regelverk för att säkerställa ett långsiktigt skydd för biologisk mångfald i terrestra ekosystem. Vidare arbetar Naturskyddsföreningen med stärkt lokal förvaltning och ökat skydd och restaurering av områden, såväl skogsområden som omkringliggande jordbruksområden.Naturskyddsföreningens och samarbetsorganisationers påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och konsumenter, samt kapacitetsstärkande insatser har för avsikt att uppnå livskraftig natur i skog och mark. Påverkansarbetet gentemot beslutsfattare, myndigheter, företag och finansiella sektorn sker nationellt i Sverige och i samarbetsländer, på EU-nivå och internationellt. Särskilt fokus ligger på att kvinnors roll i naturresursförvaltning lyfts och ges utrymme. Kapacitetsstärkande arbete för individer, organisationer och på samhällsnivå möjliggör för människor som är marginaliserade avseende såväl resurser som beslutsmöjligheter att bli informerade och kunna tala i egen rätt, organisera sig och agera självständigt.Målområde 3 Akvatiska ekosystemMål 3.1 Hållbart brukande och hållbar resursanvändningMål 3.2 Skyddade och bevarade arter, populationer och värdefulla områdenInom målområdet akvatiska ekosystem är insatserna framför allt relaterade till att stärka den biologiska mångfalden och att motverka negativ klimatpåverkan.För att bidra till livfulla vatten från källa till hav bedriver Naturskyddsföreningenpåverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare, myndigheter och i viss mån företag på nationell, EU och internationell nivå. Genom samverkan med samarbetsorganisationer och andra relevanta aktörer belyser Naturskyddsföreningen miljöförstöring, lagöverträdelser, orättvisor och brister i lagstiftning, sprider oberoende information, positioner och rapporter, initierar dialog, ingår i rådgivande organ (EU:s Long Distance Fishing Advisroy Council, LDAC) och deltar i konsultationer, högnivåmöten och konferenser. Kapacitetsstärkande insatser utgör ytterligare en central del i arbetet då Naturskyddsföreningen ser kunskap, organisering och mobilisering av individer, organisationer och nätverk som viktigt för att människor ska kunna utkräva sina rättigheter och hålla ansvarsbärare till svars. Därtill anser Naturskyddsföreningen att det behövs förändringsarbete av rådande makt och könsstrukturer inom såväl kustsamhällen som politiken. För att adressera detta ges särskilda insatser för att öka kvinnors egenmakt prioritet. Målområde 4 Människan4.3 Hållbara konsumtionskulturer4.4 Hållbar samhällsekonomiMålområde människan handlar om människan som orsak men också lösningen till miljöproblemen. Naturskyddsföreningen menar att levnadsvanor och samhällen behöver ställas om för att möjliggöra hållbara produktions- och konsumtionsmönster.Naturskyddsföreningen och dess samarbetsorganisationer arbetar för en jämställd, rättvis och hållbar omställning. Det innebär att verka för tillgång till nyttan av varor och tjänster för alla för att förlänga materialens uppehållstid i ekonomin, för att minska eller stabilisera mängden material i omlopp i ekonomin, för att stärka rätten för samhällen drabbade av miljögifter ochför att omställningen till ett fossilfritt samhälle inom de planetära gränserna sker på ett rättvist sätt.Naturskyddsföreningens Globala program arbetar inom tre områden för att placera konsumtionen och ekonomin inom dess miljömässigt och socialt hållbara utrymme: 1) Att visa på och utveckla modeller för att öka tillgången till nyttan av varor och tjänster på sätt som minskar resursuttaget, och 2) Attstärka människors och samhällens möjligheter att minska sin exponering och utsatthet för miljögifter och 3) Att skapa förutsättningar för omställning från linjära till cirkulära materialflöden i ekonomin på vis som inte är skadliga för hälsa och miljö.Vägen till miljökloka människor i hållbara samhällen menar Naturskyddsföreningen går via kapacitetsstärkande insatser, påverkansarbete och ansvarsutkrävande och arbetet präglas av ett rättighets- och jämställdhetsperspektiv, ett lokalt ägandeskap i projektstödet och ett partnerskap i gemensamt påverkansarbete. Genom att söka förstå hållbar konsumtion och produktion och dess barriärer, uppmuntra och sprida hållbara alternativ, söka dialog med forskning och bidra till nationell och regional politikutveckling vill Naturskyddsföreningen förändra dagens ohållbara produktions- och konsumtionssystem.Målområde 5 Organisationen5.2 Mer resurser till miljöarbetet5.4 En stärkt global miljörörelseAllt arbete Naturskyddsföreningen gör inom det Globala programmet bidrar till målområdet Organisationen- en stark och inflytelserik organisation. De tre byggstenarna; partnerskap genom organisationsstöd, gemensam påverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser kring sak- och systemfrågor bidrar till att stärka den egna organisationen och de som ingår i partnerskapet.Naturskyddsföreningen ska bidra till framväxten av en stark miljörörelse i låg- och medelinkomstländer, att stärka organisering, inhämtning och spridning av kunskap samt civilsamhällets utveckling av metoder för deltagande och politisk påverkan i beslut och processer som rör en hållbar utveckling.Naturskyddföreningen planerar att stödja innovativa allianser och koalitioner inom civilsamhället och med andra aktörer som verkar för hållbar utveckling och stöd till miljöförsvarare i låg- och medelinkomstländer. De metoder som Naturskyddsföreningen främjar och tillämpar ska vara baserade på demokratiska principer och fredlig mobilisering av marginaliserade grupper. I kombination med påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och makthavare på nationell, regional och internationell nivå vill Naturskyddsföreningen bidra till att främja både regelverk och folkligt deltagande för en hållbar samhällsutveckling som gynnar flertalet och håller sig inom ramarna för ekosystemens bärkraft.",18698.615,18698.615,17648.768,17648.77,15362.381,15362.381,25408.436,25408.436,Ukraine,100,General Environment Protection,,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-15038A0101-UKR-41010

Det innebär att verka för tillgång till nyttan av varor och tjänster för alla för att förlänga materialens uppehållstid i ekonomin, för att minska eller stabilisera mängden material i omlopp i ekonomin, för att stärka rätten för samhällen drabbade av miljögifter ochför att omställningen till ett fossilfritt samhälle inom de planetära gränserna sker på ett rättvist sätt.Naturskyddsföreningens Globala program arbetar inom tre områden för att placera konsumtionen och ekonomin inom dess miljömässigt och socialt hållbara utrymme: 1) Att visa på och utveckla modeller för att öka tillgången till nyttan av varor och tjänster på sätt som minskar resursuttaget, och 2) Attstärka människors och samhällens möjligheter att minska sin exponering och utsatthet för miljögifter och 3) Att skapa förutsättningar för omställning från linjära till cirkulära materialflöden i ekonomin på vis som inte är skadliga för hälsa och miljö.Vägen till miljökloka människor i hållbara samhällen menar Naturskyddsföreningen går via kapacitetsstärkande insatser, påverkansarbete och ansvarsutkrävande och arbetet präglas av ett rättighets- och jämställdhetsperspektiv, ett lokalt ägandeskap i projektstödet och ett partnerskap i gemensamt påverkansarbete. Genom att söka förstå hållbar konsumtion och produktion och dess barriärer, uppmuntra och sprida hållbara alternativ, söka dialog med forskning och bidra till nationell och regional politikutveckling vill Naturskyddsföreningen förändra dagens ohållbara produktions- och konsumtionssystem.Målområde 5 Organisationen5.2 Mer resurser till miljöarbetet5.4 En stärkt global miljörörelseAllt arbete Naturskyddsföreningen gör inom det Globala programmet bidrar till målområdet Organisationen- en stark och inflytelserik organisation. De tre byggstenarna; partnerskap genom organisationsstöd, gemensam påverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser kring sak- och systemfrågor bidrar till att stärka den egna organisationen och de som ingår i partnerskapet.Naturskyddsföreningen ska bidra till framväxten av en stark miljörörelse i låg- och medelinkomstländer, att stärka organisering, inhämtning och spridning av kunskap samt civilsamhällets utveckling av metoder för deltagande och politisk påverkan i beslut och processer som rör en hållbar utveckling.Naturskyddföreningen planerar att stödja innovativa allianser och koalitioner inom civilsamhället och med andra aktörer som verkar för hållbar utveckling och stöd till miljöförsvarare i låg- och medelinkomstländer. De metoder som Naturskyddsföreningen främjar och tillämpar ska vara baserade på demokratiska principer och fredlig mobilisering av marginaliserade grupper. I kombination med påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och makthavare på nationell, regional och internationell nivå vill Naturskyddsföreningen bidra till att främja både regelverk och folkligt deltagande för en hållbar samhällsutveckling som gynnar flertalet och håller sig inom ramarna för ekosystemens bärkraft.",18698.615,18698.615,17648.768,17648.77,15362.381,15362.381,25408.436,25408.436,Ukraine,100,Other Multisector,,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-15038A0101-UKR-43040

Effektmålen beskriver ett önskat tillstånd, förändring eller resultat, alltså denönskade effekten av arbetet. I många fall ligger själva målformuleringarna på en hög och abstrakt nivå och kan inte helt och hållet uppnås under programperioden. Vad som mer specifikt förväntas kunna åstadkommas under perioden preciseras i resultatmatrisen via de indikatorer och verksamhetsmål som är kopplade till effektmålen.Som uppställningen nedan visar rapporterar den globala verksamheten inte på alla Framtidsstrategins mål. Det har främst att göra med avgränsning, resursfördelning och var Naturskyddsföreningen och samarbetsorganisationer på bästa sätt kan bidra till måluppfyllelsen. Flera av Framtidsstrategins långsiktiga mål är kopplade till föreningens arbete i Sverige.Verksamheten följs upp utifrån den tematiska inriktningen i stället för geografiskt. Detta förstärks av att flera av samarbetsorganisationerna är globala och av att både Naturskyddsfööreningens och samarbetsorganisationernas påverkansarbete utgår från tematiska perspektiv och inte geografiska ramar.Av de långsiktiga målen som beskrivs i Framtidsstrategin ska det Globala programmet bidra till följande:Målområde 1 AtmosfärenMål 1.2 Minskade utsläpp från konsumtion och produktionMål 1.3 Hållbar energiförsörjningInom målområdet atmosfären är insatserna framför allt relaterade till att motverka klimatförändringen och att minska/utrota energifattigdom.För att bidra till en utveckling mot ren luft och begränsad klimatpåverkan arbetar Naturskyddsföreningen med påverkansarbete, konsumentmakt, samverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser. Genom organisering och forum för interaktion med beslutsfattare möjliggör samarbetsorganisationerna målgruppens och individens möjlighet till påverkan och ansvarsutkrävande från beslutsfattare, företag och banker. Detta sker genom dialogforum, nationella arbetsgrupper, uppföljning av miljökonsekvensbeskrivningar och klimaträttsfall. Samarbetsorganisationerna bidrar även till att bygga och stärka allianser nationellt och internationellt.Kapacitetsstärkande insatser fokuserar på hur en miljömässigt, socialt och ekonomiskt hållbar energiomställning med ett integrerat livscykelperspektiv kan främjas. Framtidsstrategins långsiktiga mål är att stärka samarbetsorganisationerna och Naturskyddsföreningens arbete med en rättvis omställning genom att öka kunskapen och erfarenhetsutbytet om olika perspektiv på omställningen.Målområde 2 Landbaserade ekosystemMål 2.1 Hållbart brukande och hållbar resursanvändningMål 2.2 Skyddade och bevarade arter, populationer och värdefulla områdenInom Naturskyddsföreningens målområde landbaserade ekosystem, syftar insatserna framför allt till att stärka den biologiska mångfalden och attmotverka negativ klimatpåverkan. I detta målområde fokuserar arbetet på tropiska skogar och småskaligt jordbruk.Naturskyddsföreningen arbetar för hållbara produktionssystem inom skogs- ochjordbrukssektorn och för att minska överutnyttjandet av naturresurser. Som ett led i detta arbete driver Naturskyddsföreningen på för att uppnå bindande regelverk för att säkerställa ett långsiktigt skydd för biologisk mångfald i terrestra ekosystem. Vidare arbetar Naturskyddsföreningen med stärkt lokal förvaltning och ökat skydd och restaurering av områden, såväl skogsområden som omkringliggande jordbruksområden.Naturskyddsföreningens och samarbetsorganisationers påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och konsumenter, samt kapacitetsstärkande insatser har för avsikt att uppnå livskraftig natur i skog och mark. Påverkansarbetet gentemot beslutsfattare, myndigheter, företag och finansiella sektorn sker nationellt i Sverige och i samarbetsländer, på EU-nivå och internationellt. Särskilt fokus ligger på att kvinnors roll i naturresursförvaltning lyfts och ges utrymme. Kapacitetsstärkande arbete för individer, organisationer och på samhällsnivå möjliggör för människor som är marginaliserade avseende såväl resurser som beslutsmöjligheter att bli informerade och kunna tala i egen rätt, organisera sig och agera självständigt.Målområde 3 Akvatiska ekosystemMål 3.1 Hållbart brukande och hållbar resursanvändningMål 3.2 Skyddade och bevarade arter, populationer och värdefulla områdenInom målområdet akvatiska ekosystem är insatserna framför allt relaterade till att stärka den biologiska mångfalden och att motverka negativ klimatpåverkan.För att bidra till livfulla vatten från källa till hav bedriver Naturskyddsföreningenpåverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare, myndigheter och i viss mån företag på nationell, EU och internationell nivå. Genom samverkan med samarbetsorganisationer och andra relevanta aktörer belyser Naturskyddsföreningen miljöförstöring, lagöverträdelser, orättvisor och brister i lagstiftning, sprider oberoende information, positioner och rapporter, initierar dialog, ingår i rådgivande organ (EU:s Long Distance Fishing Advisroy Council, LDAC) och deltar i konsultationer, högnivåmöten och konferenser. Kapacitetsstärkande insatser utgör ytterligare en central del i arbetet då Naturskyddsföreningen ser kunskap, organisering och mobilisering av individer, organisationer och nätverk som viktigt för att människor ska kunna utkräva sina rättigheter och hålla ansvarsbärare till svars. Därtill anser Naturskyddsföreningen att det behövs förändringsarbete av rådande makt och könsstrukturer inom såväl kustsamhällen som politiken. För att adressera detta ges särskilda insatser för att öka kvinnors egenmakt prioritet.

Det innebär att verka för tillgång till nyttan av varor och tjänster för alla för att förlänga materialens uppehållstid i ekonomin, för att minska eller stabilisera mängden material i omlopp i ekonomin, för att stärka rätten för samhällen drabbade av miljögifter ochför att omställningen till ett fossilfritt samhälle inom de planetära gränserna sker på ett rättvist sätt.Naturskyddsföreningens Globala program arbetar inom tre områden för att placera konsumtionen och ekonomin inom dess miljömässigt och socialt hållbara utrymme: 1) Att visa på och utveckla modeller för att öka tillgången till nyttan av varor och tjänster på sätt som minskar resursuttaget, och 2) Attstärka människors och samhällens möjligheter att minska sin exponering och utsatthet för miljögifter och 3) Att skapa förutsättningar för omställning från linjära till cirkulära materialflöden i ekonomin på vis som inte är skadliga för hälsa och miljö.Vägen till miljökloka människor i hållbara samhällen menar Naturskyddsföreningen går via kapacitetsstärkande insatser, påverkansarbete och ansvarsutkrävande och arbetet präglas av ett rättighets- och jämställdhetsperspektiv, ett lokalt ägandeskap i projektstödet och ett partnerskap i gemensamt påverkansarbete. Genom att söka förstå hållbar konsumtion och produktion och dess barriärer, uppmuntra och sprida hållbara alternativ, söka dialog med forskning och bidra till nationell och regional politikutveckling vill Naturskyddsföreningen förändra dagens ohållbara produktions- och konsumtionssystem.Målområde 5 Organisationen5.2 Mer resurser till miljöarbetet5.4 En stärkt global miljörörelseAllt arbete Naturskyddsföreningen gör inom det Globala programmet bidrar till målområdet Organisationen- en stark och inflytelserik organisation. De tre byggstenarna; partnerskap genom organisationsstöd, gemensam påverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser kring sak- och systemfrågor bidrar till att stärka den egna organisationen och de som ingår i partnerskapet.Naturskyddsföreningen ska bidra till framväxten av en stark miljörörelse i låg- och medelinkomstländer, att stärka organisering, inhämtning och spridning av kunskap samt civilsamhällets utveckling av metoder för deltagande och politisk påverkan i beslut och processer som rör en hållbar utveckling.Naturskyddföreningen planerar att stödja innovativa allianser och koalitioner inom civilsamhället och med andra aktörer som verkar för hållbar utveckling och stöd till miljöförsvarare i låg- och medelinkomstländer. De metoder som Naturskyddsföreningen främjar och tillämpar ska vara baserade på demokratiska principer och fredlig mobilisering av marginaliserade grupper. I kombination med påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och makthavare på nationell, regional och internationell nivå vill Naturskyddsföreningen bidra till att främja både regelverk och folkligt deltagande för en hållbar samhällsutveckling som gynnar flertalet och håller sig inom ramarna för ekosystemens bärkraft.",18698.615,18698.615,17648.768,17648.77,15362.381,15362.381,25408.436,25408.436,Ukraine,100,Government & Civil Society-general,,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-15038A0101-UKR-15160

Effektmålen beskriver ett önskat tillstånd, förändring eller resultat, alltså denönskade effekten av arbetet. I många fall ligger själva målformuleringarna på en hög och abstrakt nivå och kan inte helt och hållet uppnås under programperioden. Vad som mer specifikt förväntas kunna åstadkommas under perioden preciseras i resultatmatrisen via de indikatorer och verksamhetsmål som är kopplade till effektmålen.Som uppställningen nedan visar rapporterar den globala verksamheten inte på alla Framtidsstrategins mål. Det har främst att göra med avgränsning, resursfördelning och var Naturskyddsföreningen och samarbetsorganisationer på bästa sätt kan bidra till måluppfyllelsen. Flera av Framtidsstrategins långsiktiga mål är kopplade till föreningens arbete i Sverige.Verksamheten följs upp utifrån den tematiska inriktningen i stället för geografiskt. Detta förstärks av att flera av samarbetsorganisationerna är globala och av att både Naturskyddsfööreningens och samarbetsorganisationernas påverkansarbete utgår från tematiska perspektiv och inte geografiska ramar.Av de långsiktiga målen som beskrivs i Framtidsstrategin ska det Globala programmet bidra till följande:Målområde 1 AtmosfärenMål 1.2 Minskade utsläpp från konsumtion och produktionMål 1.3 Hållbar energiförsörjningInom målområdet atmosfären är insatserna framför allt relaterade till att motverka klimatförändringen och att minska/utrota energifattigdom.För att bidra till en utveckling mot ren luft och begränsad klimatpåverkan arbetar Naturskyddsföreningen med påverkansarbete, konsumentmakt, samverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser. Genom organisering och forum för interaktion med beslutsfattare möjliggör samarbetsorganisationerna målgruppens och individens möjlighet till påverkan och ansvarsutkrävande från beslutsfattare, företag och banker. Detta sker genom dialogforum, nationella arbetsgrupper, uppföljning av miljökonsekvensbeskrivningar och klimaträttsfall. Samarbetsorganisationerna bidrar även till att bygga och stärka allianser nationellt och internationellt.Kapacitetsstärkande insatser fokuserar på hur en miljömässigt, socialt och ekonomiskt hållbar energiomställning med ett integrerat livscykelperspektiv kan främjas. Framtidsstrategins långsiktiga mål är att stärka samarbetsorganisationerna och Naturskyddsföreningens arbete med en rättvis omställning genom att öka kunskapen och erfarenhetsutbytet om olika perspektiv på omställningen.Målområde 2 Landbaserade ekosystemMål 2.1 Hållbart brukande och hållbar resursanvändningMål 2.2 Skyddade och bevarade arter, populationer och värdefulla områdenInom Naturskyddsföreningens målområde landbaserade ekosystem, syftar insatserna framför allt till att stärka den biologiska mångfalden och attmotverka negativ klimatpåverkan. I detta målområde fokuserar arbetet på tropiska skogar och småskaligt jordbruk.Naturskyddsföreningen arbetar för hållbara produktionssystem inom skogs- ochjordbrukssektorn och för att minska överutnyttjandet av naturresurser. Som ett led i detta arbete driver Naturskyddsföreningen på för att uppnå bindande regelverk för att säkerställa ett långsiktigt skydd för biologisk mångfald i terrestra ekosystem. Vidare arbetar Naturskyddsföreningen med stärkt lokal förvaltning och ökat skydd och restaurering av områden, såväl skogsområden som omkringliggande jordbruksområden.Naturskyddsföreningens och samarbetsorganisationers påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och konsumenter, samt kapacitetsstärkande insatser har för avsikt att uppnå livskraftig natur i skog och mark. Påverkansarbetet gentemot beslutsfattare, myndigheter, företag och finansiella sektorn sker nationellt i Sverige och i samarbetsländer, på EU-nivå och internationellt. Särskilt fokus ligger på att kvinnors roll i naturresursförvaltning lyfts och ges utrymme. Kapacitetsstärkande arbete för individer, organisationer och på samhällsnivå möjliggör för människor som är marginaliserade avseende såväl resurser som beslutsmöjligheter att bli informerade och kunna tala i egen rätt, organisera sig och agera självständigt.Målområde 3 Akvatiska ekosystemMål 3.1 Hållbart brukande och hållbar resursanvändningMål 3.2 Skyddade och bevarade arter, populationer och värdefulla områdenInom målområdet akvatiska ekosystem är insatserna framför allt relaterade till att stärka den biologiska mångfalden och att motverka negativ klimatpåverkan.För att bidra till livfulla vatten från källa till hav bedriver Naturskyddsföreningenpåverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare, myndigheter och i viss mån företag på nationell, EU och internationell nivå. Genom samverkan med samarbetsorganisationer och andra relevanta aktörer belyser Naturskyddsföreningen miljöförstöring, lagöverträdelser, orättvisor och brister i lagstiftning, sprider oberoende information, positioner och rapporter, initierar dialog, ingår i rådgivande organ (EU:s Long Distance Fishing Advisroy Council, LDAC) och deltar i konsultationer, högnivåmöten och konferenser. Kapacitetsstärkande insatser utgör ytterligare en central del i arbetet då Naturskyddsföreningen ser kunskap, organisering och mobilisering av individer, organisationer och nätverk som viktigt för att människor ska kunna utkräva sina rättigheter och hålla ansvarsbärare till svars. Därtill anser Naturskyddsföreningen att det behövs förändringsarbete av rådande makt och könsstrukturer inom såväl kustsamhällen som politiken. För att adressera detta ges särskilda insatser för att öka kvinnors egenmakt prioritet.

Det innebär att verka för tillgång till nyttan av varor och tjänster för alla för att förlänga materialens uppehållstid i ekonomin, för att minska eller stabilisera mängden material i omlopp i ekonomin, för att stärka rätten för samhällen drabbade av miljögifter ochför att omställningen till ett fossilfritt samhälle inom de planetära gränserna sker på ett rättvist sätt.Naturskyddsföreningens Globala program arbetar inom tre områden för att placera konsumtionen och ekonomin inom dess miljömässigt och socialt hållbara utrymme: 1) Att visa på och utveckla modeller för att öka tillgången till nyttan av varor och tjänster på sätt som minskar resursuttaget, och 2) Attstärka människors och samhällens möjligheter att minska sin exponering och utsatthet för miljögifter och 3) Att skapa förutsättningar för omställning från linjära till cirkulära materialflöden i ekonomin på vis som inte är skadliga för hälsa och miljö.Vägen till miljökloka människor i hållbara samhällen menar Naturskyddsföreningen går via kapacitetsstärkande insatser, påverkansarbete och ansvarsutkrävande och arbetet präglas av ett rättighets- och jämställdhetsperspektiv, ett lokalt ägandeskap i projektstödet och ett partnerskap i gemensamt påverkansarbete. Genom att söka förstå hållbar konsumtion och produktion och dess barriärer, uppmuntra och sprida hållbara alternativ, söka dialog med forskning och bidra till nationell och regional politikutveckling vill Naturskyddsföreningen förändra dagens ohållbara produktions- och konsumtionssystem.Målområde 5 Organisationen5.2 Mer resurser till miljöarbetet5.4 En stärkt global miljörörelseAllt arbete Naturskyddsföreningen gör inom det Globala programmet bidrar till målområdet Organisationen- en stark och inflytelserik organisation. De tre byggstenarna; partnerskap genom organisationsstöd, gemensam påverkan och kapacitetsstärkande insatser kring sak- och systemfrågor bidrar till att stärka den egna organisationen och de som ingår i partnerskapet.Naturskyddsföreningen ska bidra till framväxten av en stark miljörörelse i låg- och medelinkomstländer, att stärka organisering, inhämtning och spridning av kunskap samt civilsamhällets utveckling av metoder för deltagande och politisk påverkan i beslut och processer som rör en hållbar utveckling.Naturskyddföreningen planerar att stödja innovativa allianser och koalitioner inom civilsamhället och med andra aktörer som verkar för hållbar utveckling och stöd till miljöförsvarare i låg- och medelinkomstländer. De metoder som Naturskyddsföreningen främjar och tillämpar ska vara baserade på demokratiska principer och fredlig mobilisering av marginaliserade grupper. I kombination med påverkansarbete gentemot beslutsfattare och makthavare på nationell, regional och internationell nivå vill Naturskyddsföreningen bidra till att främja både regelverk och folkligt deltagande för en hållbar samhällsutveckling som gynnar flertalet och håller sig inom ramarna för ekosystemens bärkraft.",18698.615,18698.615,17648.768,17648.77,15362.381,15362.381,25408.436,25408.436,Ukraine,100,Government & Civil Society-general,,50,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=SE-0-SE-6-15038A0101-UKR-15150

By delivering health, water, sanitation and nutrition services, we will ensure that children survive this devastating crisis. By focusing on social and emotional wellbeing and with our safe return to learning approach, we will ensure that children continue to learn, despite displacement and disruption to education services. By prioritising services for particularly vulnerable children, unaccompanied minors and children with disabilities and by providing services to prevent, trace and reunify families, we will ensure that children are protected from additional harm. By distributing cash grants and vouchers, we will ensure that children and their families have a safety net to get them through this crisis and build resilience. And by advocating with governments across the globe, we will ensure that the rights of children are upheld.

Through this mechanism, for every eligible donation made to the Canadian Red Cross’s Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Appeal, between February 24 and March 18, the Government of Canada will transfer an equivalent amount to the CRC, up to a total of $10 million.

The UN estimates that over 12 million people will need humanitarian assistance over the next three months and the UNHCR estimates that as many as 4 million people could seek refuge in neighbouring countries. On March 1, 2022, humanitarian partners issued appeals for approximately USD 2 billion to support the humanitarian response inside Ukraine over the next three months as well as the humanitarian needs of Ukrainians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. In light of the complexity of the crisis, it is anticipated that humanitarian needs will grow commensurately, which will require ongoing donor support to allow partners to scale up their humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, People in Need is providing assistance to address growing humanitarian needs in the region. This project focuses on providing immediate support services through multi-purpose cash and vouchers, non-food items, and providing protection services to at-risk children.  Project activities include: (1) providing multi-purpose cash and vouchers and non-food items assistance to conflict-affected girls, boys and their communities; (2) providing mental health and psychosocial support conflict-affected children, including unaccompanied and separated children; and (3) providing case management and protection services to boys, girls, including unaccompanied and separated children, and their communities.",3679607.8,3679607.8,3473013.5,3473013.5,3023086.8,3023086.8,5000000,5000000,Ukraine,100,Emergency Response,Material relief assistance and services,100,,,30.5238,50.45466,2,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=CA-3-P011593001

In light of the complexity of the crisis, it is anticipated that humanitarian needs will grow commensurately, which will require ongoing donor support to allow partners to scale up their humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  With GAC’s support, Humanity and Inclusion is providing assistance to address growing humanitarian needs in Ukraine. This project focuses on the provision of health, protection and basic needs services to vulnerable populations in Ukraine, including persons with disabilities, injuries and/or with signs of psychological distress.

The overall scale and unpredictability of the situation requires immediate humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable displaced and conflict-affected communities. Through field visits, including to areas heavily affected by the hostilities, IOM has observed that displaced families originating from the newly accessible areas are beginning to return to their houses, many of which have sustained damage of various degrees. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) and non-displaced families also often stay in damaged houses unable to provide sufficient protection from harsh weather conditions. In many cases the damage is relatively minor and could be repaired by residents themselves if provided access to construction materials and resources. IOM therefore proposes to provide conflict-affected households in Kyiv Oblast with construction materials for self-driven repairs with guidance from IOM’s technical teams. In addition, IOM aims to strengthen prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) and respond to the incidents that can occur during the Ukraine Crisis, as well as support the inter-agency collective response in Ukraine.",2990072,31065.76,2822192.2,29321.55,2456579,25522.96,4063031,42213.414,Ukraine,100,Emergency Response,Material relief assistance and services,100,,IOM Country Office - UA,30.522472,50.452145,2,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-DAC-47066-SN.0194

The  Humanitarian Aid Centre  for IDPs is still working and is a center of primary needs help for them.  Zaporizhzhia is in a unique situation, as a major city both facing regular attacks and as a transit point and destination for internally displaced persons (IDPs) fleeing the east, particularly Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Since March 2022, Posmishka UA has been extremely active in the Kopychyntsi region of Ternopil oblast, collaborating closely with authorities to meet the needs of IDP communities. \n\nDrawing on our exception presence, visibility and connections in both regions, we are proposing this project, which speaks directly to the needs of the communities we work with on a daily basis. Firstly, in Kopychyntsi, the local authorities and communities have noted that the water and sewerage system is no longer fit for purpose, strained by the increased demand of IDP populations which have moved to the region with our support, the municipality can make real strides towards improving not only access but also the quality and sustainability of the water and sewerage systems locally. In the context of Zaporizhzhia, IDP communities desperately require hygiene support, and so we plan to distribute kits.

As temperatures plunge, schools open, and host communities tire, households, especially vulnerable households, need mid-term shelter solutions to ensure their health, security and well-being. Rental assistance is the critical shelter need identified by the Winterization plan released by the Protection Cluster-Ukraine, representing approximately 40% of the anticipated $361 million required according to the current humanitarian response plan. Lviv, as the Oblast with the highest number of IDPs, partners need to support with rental assistance. Therefore, CORE proposes a rental assistance program in Lviv that would prioritize supporting the most vulnerable IDPs in collective centers by providing them with rental assistance and placements into safe accommodations for six months.\n\nCORE conducted a rapid shelter-specific needs assessment, revealing that more than 50% of people living at collective centers would like to move out to more private settings where they have autonomy and private services. In Lviv alone, numerous collective centers anticipate that several thousand families will seek rental options privately if they receive rental subsidies. CORE proposes a market-based rental assistance model wherein the real-estate agents are incentivized to identify suitable rentals and assist families in obtaining a six-month lease. \n\nCORE will work with local government and shelter partners to identify 300 vulnerable IDP households living in collective shelters in Lviv City. CORE will connect them to real estate agents who will identify and place households in adequate individual apartments during the 2022-2023 winter and support placements. CORE will provide these 300 households with six months of rental assistance and one-time settlement and winterization stipends. \n\nTargeting: CORE will target the most vulnerable households staying in collective centers according to a vulnerability survey aligned with the Shelter Cluster Technical Working Group on Rental Assistance. CORE will prioritize rental assistance support for families with pregnant and lactating women, families with at least two minor dependents, families with at least one person with a disability, and families coming from Ukraine's most heavily conflict-affected regions. \n\nRisk Mitigation: Primary risks are insufficient available shelter, and shifts in rental costs present challenges in meeting the proposed reach. CORE will work with local real estate partners to mitigate these risks, leveraging their rental listing databases and extensive networks for finding rental housing. CORE’s lawyer/rental expert will be responsible for developing and executing the rental agreements. Agreements will be in-line with local legal and tax requirements. CORE will continue to defer to the Cash Working Group and Shelter cluster recommendations. CORE will orient the participating real estate agents on PSEA and GBV prevention and humanitarian standards for working with displaced populations and raise beneficiary awareness to mitigate protection risks. \n\nApproach:  CORE will provide rental assistance directly to beneficiaries via bank transfer.  CORE will also provide supplementary start-up resources. Working with real estate firms will enable CORE to ensure apartments are vetted, minimize protection risks, and mitigate potential fraud. Rental assistance rates will be in-line with the shelter sector recommendations.",698363.3,279345.34,659153.2,263661.28,573760.3,229504.11,948964.4,379585.75,Ukraine,100,Other Multisector,Multisector aid,100,,Lvivska,23.9166,49.717365,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-OCHA-CBPF-UKR-22/UKR_CBPF/SA1/S-NFI/INGO/23498

The project focuses on providing aid not only in IDPs hubs but also in rural areas, where access to international and volunteering assistance is lower according to reports from shelter coordinators and local authorities. \nThe NGO, ""Podolian Agency for Regional Development,"" applies in consortium with the society of people with disabilities, the Public Organization ""Vinnytsia Regional Organization of the Disabled ""Samodopomoga,"" and the Public Organization ""Eastern-Ukrainian Patriotic Association,"" which was forced to evacuate from the city of Kramatorsk, Donetsk region.\nThe project has two main components: (1) preparing shelters for the winter season, (2) food security and livelihoods, and cross-cutting activities to ensure inclusion and accountability.\n\nI.\tShelter and NFIs\nThe project will work with existing shelters for IDPs under the NGO ""PARD"" patronage and engage new ones. The project will support 1000 people in nine shelters and keep the flexibility to react to new challenges if more shelters require support. \nWith project help, people who live in them will receive assistance in the form of NFI (warm clothes, blankets, underwear, dignity kits) critical for the winter period. One shelter will receive repairing of premises for coordination, training, and information events. \nNGO ""Samodopomoga"" sew sleeping bags from March 2022 to help IDPs. This production will be adapted to help people in need to overcome the winter period.\n\nII.\tFood security and livelihoods\nIn cooperation with NGO Samodopomoga, the Vocational and Technical Education Center No. 1 has had a kitchen for cooking bread baking, which covers the needs of IPD families in this shelter and can be delivered to other shelters. The applicant also has equipment for producing frozen semi-finished products from meat  (cutlets, ravioli, etc.), which is not installed because the shelter's kitchen does not meet food-producing standards. Within this grant, NGO PARD and partners will repair kitchen premises according to HACCP standards, procure meat, milk and other food, dairy kitchen and refrigerating equipment. Products will be bought to ensure nutrition quality according to FSLC recommendations. Thus, 1000 people living in nine existing shelters will be provided food in the form of semi-finished products and dry food products (IDPs could cook at shelter kitchens) during winter.\n\nIII.\tInclusion and accountability\nNGO ""EUPA"" has experience working in conditions of humanitarian crisis and conflict since 2015 in eastern Ukraine. Specialists of the organization will ensure compliance with the standards on accountability to the affected population (AAP) and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), the minimum requirements for the protection of children in humanitarian activities from 2019, and the Guidelines of the ICRC ""Inclusion of people with disabilities in humanitarian activities,"" 2019, standards and recommendations of clusters.\nThis cross-cutting component is aimed both at the project employees and the external audience. The project team will work with beneficiaries at each stage of the project cycle to receive feedback and take it into account in the work, raising awareness of people, including children and people with disabilities, who live in shelters and need help. The project team will conduct training and information events for local self-government employees and civil servants to improve their skills in humanitarian standards and work with a vulnerable population.\nThe project will have an appropriate MEAL system, feedback, and complaints forms, which will help remove barriers and improve the quality of assistance and services provided to the war-affected population.

In addition, due to the serious interruptions of the public services people are migrating to rural areas of the Oblast in order to have better chances to survive the upcoming winter. HIA’s local partner in the area confirmed that there is very little support and the number of active NGOs is very small at present in these areas which will either result in people moving on to other regions or those staying there will need assistance as an extra-vulnerable community not to mention the already high number of IDPs in the Oblast.

In both locations this project addresses the most urgent Shelter needs among the most vulnerable IDPs in Transcarpathia and the most vulnerable of the non-displaced in Chernihiv. \n\nTranscarpathia Oblast has a total population of 1.2 million. Since the invasion of Russia in February 2022, many people have fled their homes and found refuge in Transcarpathia. In the beginning, fighting and attacks were seen throughout many regions of the country and within the first week already more than 600,000 people had fled the country. Transcarpathia was one of the few regions where there had been no attacks and with a significantly reduced threat of fighting compared to the rest of the country. It, therefore, became a safe haven for many Ukrainians. According to the Oblast government the latest number of IDPs, shared on August 22nd,  is 410,000 people. For the Transcarpathian population, this is an increase of more than 30 percent and this number is still increasing. The oblast government is also expecting a large increase of IDPs during the winter months, as temperatures will drop and many people live in bad conditions. Transcarpathia is known as one of Ukraine’s warmer regions, and the heating systems have not been damaged by the war. Therefore it is expected that more people will arrive in this oblast in the coming weeks. \n\nIn Transcarpathia, this project will focus specifically on IDPs with a disability and elderly IDPs. These two groups are among the most vulnerable and highly dependent on aid. Among thousands of other IDPs, the disabled and the elderly were from the beginning hosted in collective centers, such as schools, kindergartens, and sports halls. These places are not suitable for PWD. In Transcarpathia there are rehabilitation centers and elderly homes willing to host specifically these IDPs, however, they lack the capacity. This project will focus on increasing the capacity of these types of locations to create suitable homes for disabled IDPs and elderly IDPs. \n\nChernihiv Oblast has a total population of 976.000. During the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chernihiv Oblast was one of the first regions where Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed. Heavy fighting occurred around the city of Chernihiv, which is the major route connecting West Russia and Belarus to the capital of Ukraine, Kiev, which is 105 km south of the border. The Russians completed a blockade around the city and essentially cut it off from the outside world. However, the Russians could not break the defenses and suffered heavy losses in material and morale. \nThe intense fighting resulted in widespread destruction of infrastructure, public buildings, and private properties, as well as large scale displacement of the affected population. According to the Chernihiv Oblast government, it is not yet known how many people have damaged houses, but an estimated 3.500 people lost their homes completely, and a much larger number suffered light to medium damage to their properties. \n\nCurrently, the situation in Chernihiv is calm with only sporadic attacks on targeted facilities. However, with the ongoing hostilities in the east and the close proximity to the Russian border, this could change in the future. However, shelter support for the population in Chernihiv is needed as the winters in this area are cold, bitter, and harsh, with temperatures occasionally dropping to below -20°C . December and January are generally the coldest months of the year.\n\nThe proposed Shelter intervention aims to provide relief to disabled IDPs currently living in locations that are not fit for disabled people, by rehabilitating and refurbishing collective centers by increasing the hosting capacity and simultaneously respond to the urgent winterization needs in Chernihiv by providing them the ability to stay in their rebuilt homes.",699973.8,279989.53,660673.3,264269.3,575083.44,230033.39,951152.8,380461.12,Ukraine,100,Other Multisector,Multisector aid,100,,Chernihivska,32.0038,51.35504,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-OCHA-CBPF-UKR-22/UKR_CBPF/SA1/S-NFI/INGO/23526

The intervention can rely on the approaches and best practices developed by the consortium during the first phase of the emergency response and while jointly delivering education and child protection services under the UHF Third Reserve Allocation (UKR-22/UKR_CBPF/RA3/E-P/INGO/21915). \nThe consortium proposes a harmonized and integrated approach ensuring a wider and effective impact, leveraging strengths, as well as ensuring program efficiency and value for money. AVSI and Emmaus NGO can rely on a well-established presence in targeted locations with offices, warehouse, volunteers and resources already engaged in providing lifesaving assistance to IDPs, host communities and vulnerable groups. The project will maximize the impact counting on synergies with similar education and CP interventions implemented in the target locations: AVSI has secured funds from ECW, the Italian Government and private donations. \nThe partnership structure will be kept as follow: AVSI takes the lead in the overall management, coordination and technical capacity building while holding the technical expertise in education and protection the local implementing partner Emmaus will be engaged throughout the action in the co-design of the implementation modality while being responsible for the majority of the field activities. The governance structure will ensure that all parties involved can contribute with their technical and unique added value to the partnership. Operational and administrative arrangements already in place for the implementation of ongoing projects will be adopted for the proposed intervention in order to allow smooth and timely implementation of activities while AVSI finalizes the registration process beside ensuring prompt inception of the project in continuity with phase one of the intervention currently ongoing. \nActivities will take into consideration the volatile and unpredictable context. Since 24th February 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to the internal displacement of an estimated 6,9M civilians out of which 2.5M children. Multiple shocks have left people living in hosting places feeling helpless, prone to structural violence, abuse. Vulnerable women and children are forced into behaviors which expose them to exploitation and abuse, especially children with poor or no access to learning opportunities and protective environments. The negative impact of school closures is amplified by the deterioration of students’ mental health since the start of the invasion. Recurrent and extended periods of stress ensuing from the war and displacement are especially harmful to children. \n\nThe intervention is in line with the cluster priorities set out in the UHF 1st Allocation Strategy 2022, the revised Flash Appeal, and the Regional Refugees Response Plan, mainstreaming cross-cutting themes such as Protection, AAP, Gender and Age, Disability, Inclusion.

The intervention can rely on the approaches and best practices developed by the consortium during the first phase of the emergency response and while jointly delivering education and child protection services under the UHF Third Reserve Allocation (UKR-22/UKR_CBPF/RA3/E-P/INGO/21915). \nThe consortium proposes a harmonized and integrated approach ensuring a wider and effective impact, leveraging strengths, as well as ensuring program efficiency and value for money. AVSI and Emmaus NGO can rely on a well-established presence in targeted locations with offices, warehouse, volunteers and resources already engaged in providing lifesaving assistance to IDPs, host communities and vulnerable groups. The project will maximize the impact counting on synergies with similar education and CP interventions implemented in the target locations: AVSI has secured funds from ECW, the Italian Government and private donations. \nThe partnership structure will be kept as follow: AVSI takes the lead in the overall management, coordination and technical capacity building while holding the technical expertise in education and protection the local implementing partner Emmaus will be engaged throughout the action in the co-design of the implementation modality while being responsible for the majority of the field activities. The governance structure will ensure that all parties involved can contribute with their technical and unique added value to the partnership. Operational and administrative arrangements already in place for the implementation of ongoing projects will be adopted for the proposed intervention in order to allow smooth and timely implementation of activities while AVSI finalizes the registration process beside ensuring prompt inception of the project in continuity with phase one of the intervention currently ongoing. \nActivities will take into consideration the volatile and unpredictable context. Since 24th February 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to the internal displacement of an estimated 6,9M civilians out of which 2.5M children. Multiple shocks have left people living in hosting places feeling helpless, prone to structural violence, abuse. Vulnerable women and children are forced into behaviors which expose them to exploitation and abuse, especially children with poor or no access to learning opportunities and protective environments. The negative impact of school closures is amplified by the deterioration of students’ mental health since the start of the invasion. Recurrent and extended periods of stress ensuing from the war and displacement are especially harmful to children. \n\nThe intervention is in line with the cluster priorities set out in the UHF 1st Allocation Strategy 2022, the revised Flash Appeal, and the Regional Refugees Response Plan, mainstreaming cross-cutting themes such as Protection, AAP, Gender and Age, Disability, Inclusion.

EEF will run two waves of small grants: under the first wave, it will award 10 grants of up to US$ 30,000 to provide shelter support under the second wave, it will award for at least 15 grants of up to US$ 25,000 to local organizations to provide NFI support.\n\nDuring the selection process and grant implementation period, EEF will provide mentoring and coordination support in revising application forms for selected candidates, grant management, consulting on how to provide SNFI support in adherence to the principles of accountability to affected populations (AAP) and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), verification of narrative and financial reports of the organizations. To ensure that the assistance under the project gets to those who most need it, EEF will work with both organizations known to it through its other programs and those that are new to EEF. Special attention will be paid to including women’s organizations, especially small CSOs, Community-based organizations (CBOs), and volunteer organizations. \n\nUnder O2, EEF will develop and roll out to its 25 subgrantees under Outcome 1 a comprehensive capacity-building program. In order to help CSOs assess their institutional development needs, EEF will offer its subgrantees an Organizational Capacity Assessment (OCA) – a structured tool for the facilitated self-assessment of the organization's capacity that leads to action planning to improve the capacity. Based on the OCA outcomes and feedback received from CSOs, EEF will provide its subgrantees with tailored capacity-building and mentorship opportunities.  \n\nAn important component of the project is the development of a distance-learning course for Ukrainian CSOs on principles of providing humanitarian assistance, including AAP/PSEA. The course will be developed and uploaded on EEF’s Zrozumilo! distance-learning platform (zrozumilo.in.ua). After it is tested on an initial group of students, it will be available free of charge to everyone interested subject to a simple and free registration on the platform. This approach will create an important resource that can be used in future by all Ukrainian civil society organizations and volunteer groups that wish to work with OCHA UHF.  \n\nThe capacity-building measures include online and offline training events and workshops online self-paced training courses networking events. Partner CSOs will be able to benefit from EEF’s online training in such important areas as financial discipline and audit, fundamentals of project management, monitoring and evaluation, fundraising.",932280.3,559368.2,879936.75,513430.72,765941.44,447586.1,1266820.2,755227.6,Ukraine,100,Other Multisector,Multisector aid,100,,Dnipropetrovska,34.731735,48.417015,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-OCHA-CBPF-UKR-22/UKR_CBPF/SA1/S-NFI/NGO/23555

With large-scale destruction of infrastructure, the needs for long-term and affordable housing among conflict-affected communities are expected to be immense in the short and medium to long-term. Furthermore, the extreme stress on social services and resources have increased the risk of tensions among war-affected communities. To address conflict-affected populations’ need for long-term and affordable housing, IOM has developed a transitional approach that focuses on remodelling government buildings into apartment buildings, building apartments using a modular pre-fabrication approach, and repairing affected apartments and houses. To ensure sustainability of the intervention and avoid the unintentional segregation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and non-internally displaced persons, IOM aims to integrate housing solutions in the urban planning and development programmes of 12 municipalities in West and Central Ukraine targeted by IOM’s ongoing housing programming. The project also seeks to build trust amongst community members and authorities by promoting constructive inter-group action through community-driven initiatives.

This project is aimed at covering the main aspects of the humanitarian mine action (HMA) process, that should be implemented in the current circumstances in Ukraine. HMA activities will be conducted both in cooperation with local authorities (hromadas), as well as through direct interactions with target vulnerable groups of individuals. Activities will be coordinated in conjunction with the MASC.\n1. Humanitarian demining (HD)\nTo increase national capacity the UDA with the help of a new international partner provides the training of 10 deminers of the EOD2 and EOD3 levels from the state and non-state HMA operators. Ukraine lacks deminers with EOD qualifications at 2/3 levels. These are technicians of the command staff, which will help the HMA operators to deploy demining groups and carry out their job safely and effectively. \nTo create a sustainable response to the ongoing war in Ukraine, especially to the huge ERW contamination, UDA will provide HD in Makariv hromada. UDA earlier signed a MoU with Makariv hromada in order to help local conflict-affected people and in 2022 identified more than 11 mln. m2 of suspected and confirmed hazardous areas in Makariv hromada, which now requires urgent HD interventions. UDA will release not less than 500,000 m2 of agricultural land of Makariv hromada’s territory.\nAfter the liberation of the Ukrainian lands, many territories are yet to be surveyed. In this project, the UDA will focus on the Non-Technical Survey (NTS) of the territories of hromadas where the survey has not even begun yet, for example, in Sumy and Kharkiv oblast and other conflict-affected hromadas. NTS will help start the procedures for the release of agricultural land. During this Project we will survey not less than 20,000,000 m2 of the territory of the most conflict-affected areas and will submit around 60 NTS reports to the Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA). \n2. Mine victims’ assistance (MVA)\nUDA would like to further utilize the experience in humanitarian assistance, that we have gained since the start of the full-scale invasion. The project involves comprehensive direct cash assistance to the mine victims (MV) in the most conflict-affected hromadas. \nMVA will include three main steps: interviewing the victim, protection counselling, direct cash assistance and PDM. The amount of assistance is set to 500 USD. UDA will provide such kind of assistance to mine victims based on the database of those we have been collecting since February 24 2022. Apart from our database, we will identify and verify other victims through cooperation with the most conflict-affected hromadas, social protection services, and medical facilities within them. The project will help 100 victims. All assistance shall be provided with respect to the rules and provisions set forth by the Law of Ukraine on Mine Action in Ukraine, the National MA Standard, and the IMAS recommendations.\n3. Explosive ordnance risk education (EORE)\nWith the outbreak of a full-scale war, UDA began to hold EORE sessions throughout Ukraine in various formats. In 2022 UDA received a new EORE certificate from MAC. The peculiarity of these events will be that the session will be held in combination with sessions of Conflict Preparedness and Protection (CPP) of civilian population (experience gained from previous UDA’s projects, including projects with international organizations such as MAG and NPA).

This project is aimed at covering the main aspects of the humanitarian mine action (HMA) process, that should be implemented in the current circumstances in Ukraine. HMA activities will be conducted both in cooperation with local authorities (hromadas), as well as through direct interactions with target vulnerable groups of individuals. Activities will be coordinated in conjunction with the MASC.\n1. Humanitarian demining (HD)\nTo increase national capacity the UDA with the help of a new international partner provides the training of 10 deminers of the EOD2 and EOD3 levels from the state and non-state HMA operators. Ukraine lacks deminers with EOD qualifications at 2/3 levels. These are technicians of the command staff, which will help the HMA operators to deploy demining groups and carry out their job safely and effectively. \nTo create a sustainable response to the ongoing war in Ukraine, especially to the huge ERW contamination, UDA will provide HD in Makariv hromada. UDA earlier signed a MoU with Makariv hromada in order to help local conflict-affected people and in 2022 identified more than 11 mln. m2 of suspected and confirmed hazardous areas in Makariv hromada, which now requires urgent HD interventions. UDA will release not less than 500,000 m2 of agricultural land of Makariv hromada’s territory.\nAfter the liberation of the Ukrainian lands, many territories are yet to be surveyed. In this project, the UDA will focus on the Non-Technical Survey (NTS) of the territories of hromadas where the survey has not even begun yet, for example, in Sumy and Kharkiv oblast and other conflict-affected hromadas. NTS will help start the procedures for the release of agricultural land. During this Project we will survey not less than 20,000,000 m2 of the territory of the most conflict-affected areas and will submit around 60 NTS reports to the Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA). \n2. Mine victims’ assistance (MVA)\nUDA would like to further utilize the experience in humanitarian assistance, that we have gained since the start of the full-scale invasion. The project involves comprehensive direct cash assistance to the mine victims (MV) in the most conflict-affected hromadas. \nMVA will include three main steps: interviewing the victim, protection counselling, direct cash assistance and PDM. The amount of assistance is set to 500 USD. UDA will provide such kind of assistance to mine victims based on the database of those we have been collecting since February 24 2022. Apart from our database, we will identify and verify other victims through cooperation with the most conflict-affected hromadas, social protection services, and medical facilities within them.

Local organizations, ranging from CSOs to volunteer groups, have been at the forefront of the response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine caused by the invasion by the Russian Forces on February 24th, 2022. They have been providing immediate and invaluable life-saving support to conflict-affected people in hard-to-reach areas, reaching the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, people with disabilities/special needs, children, and women. They can operate in remote locations, including small communities in rural and peri-urban areas in Western and Central Ukraine, and in conflict-affected areas of Eastern and Southern Ukraine. \nHowever, the majority of CSOs and volunteer groups are facing lack of funds, supply chain, equipment, and staff. Material support and capacity building are crucial to ensure they keep providing support to affected communities, as well as capitalize on their potential to grow, provide better services and access further international funding. To improve CSOs operating environment and strengthen their capacities, ACTED will provide material and technical support to three categories of partners, according to their capacities and needs:\n\n-\tCategory 1 partners: organizations working in stable areas in Western and Central Ukraine. ACTED will focus on increasing their capacities, through providing them with capacity building through its GOCA (Grassroots Organization Capacity Assessment) flagship initiative, as well as technical/material support and for the direct implementation of Protection, WASH, Shelter, and FSL activities.\n-\tCategory 2 partners: organizations working in conflict-affected, volatile areas in the South and East of Ukraine. ACTED and IMPACT will offer dedicated technical support, focusing on improving their duty of care, decision-making, their security measures and processes, their planning/use of assessments, the mainstreaming of the Do No Harm principle, and the application to financial grants in the sectors of Protection, WASH, Shelter, and FSL.\n-\tCategory 3 partners (Self-help/volunteer groups): as a pilot project/program, ACTED will provide mini-grants for individual volunteers without resources and working in Lviv and Mykolaiv oblasts. These mini grants will be an extra-flexible form of support for the purchase of in-kind equipment and material.\n\nIn the aftermath of the escalation, ACTED has built on its experience, reputation, and capacity to rapidly scale-up and expand programming to deliver gender-sensitive, lifesaving, and life-preserving aid, also  by scaling up the involvement in its programming of local CSO. ACTED has developed a solid local network of over 170 partners, with seven offices located throughout the country, and has the demonstrated capacity to deliver multisectoral assistance to conflict-affected populations in all 24 oblasts. Through this project, ACTED will support and strengthen the capacity of 52 local organizations (15 under Category 1, 27 under Category 2 and 10 volunteers), enabling them to scale up their operations via providing an efficient and tailored response to the needs of the most vulnerable in hard-to-reach rural areas in Ukraine. ACTED estimates to reach 17,724 beneficiaries through the activities implemented by seven identified Category 1 partners. These actions will additionally benefit from a detailed profiling of “Category 2 CSO/NGOs” undertaken by IMPACT to provide information on 1) type of local actors working in the area, 2) type of activities undertaken, 3) concerns and priorities, and 4) their ability to meet the needs of the population in the area.

Many health facilities are either in conflict areas or in areas where control has changed hands, leaving the health system vulnerable to infrastructural damage and severe disruptions. Following the attacks of 10 October 2022, and the intensification of hostilities, civil infrastructure has also been targeted, leading to reports of around 715 attacks[1] on healthcare with 100 deaths and 129 injuries. Consequently, there is limited or no access to health facilities, medicines, or healthcare workers in some areas of Ukraine. These attacks deprive the most vulnerable people (including people with disabilities) of urgently needed care, endanger healthcare providers and undermine health systems. The population is also living under the constant menace of chemical, biological and radio-nuclear threats.lt/pgtltpgtltbrgtThe project is designed to improve the availability of and access to healthcare in the conflict-affected oblasts of Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporizhia, and Mikolaiv.  In order to address the health needs related to the aforementioned hostilities, WHO proposes a project that will work to strengthen health facilities and better capacitate health workers and first responders to deliver critically needed health services to conflict-affected people, especially the most vulnerable.  This will be achieved through the deployment of mobile medical teams and/or medical staff, prepositioning of medicines, supplies and equipment, capacity building of first responders, and continuing to assess the needs in order to respond accordingly. ltbrgtltbrgt_________________________________________________ltbrgt[1] https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/364886ltbrgtlt/pgt",5714482,5714482,5245187,5245187,4572521,4572521,7715374.5,7715374.5,Ukraine,100,Other Multisector,Multisector aid,100,,,,,,,UKR,UA,http://d-portal.org/q.html?aid=XM-OCHA-CBPF-CBPF-UKR-23-R-UN-24515
